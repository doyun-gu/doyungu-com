/* The above (0s, 0.5s, 1s) creates a cascading effect.
   For the *specific* 1-2-3-2-1 visual cycle where it grows and shrinks one after another,
   we need the total cycle to be longer or the delay to be a fraction of the full cycle.
   Let's consider a total cycle for all dots to complete the 1-2-3-2-1 sequence.

   If animation is 2s:
   Dot 1: 0s start
   Dot 2: 0.25s start
   Dot 3: 0.5s start

   When dot 3 peaks, dot 2 will be falling, dot 1 will be near bottom. This creates a wave.
   If you want *true* 1-2-3-2-1 in sequence, you need to think about the full cycle.
   Let's make the animation duration longer and use specific delays for a more pronounced wave.
